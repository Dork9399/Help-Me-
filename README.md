Project Name: Help Me!
Description: Help Me! is an all-in-one app for emergencies, whether it is a car accident or you are experiencing minor pain. The specialty of the app consists of a pain report, when the user can send a report about the pain that they are having. Then, they can connect to a doctor online through a chatting-based system, meaning they do not have to drive all the way to a doctor to help their pain.
